* The HTTP 418 I'm a teapot client error response code indicates that the server refuses to brew coffee because it is a teapot. This error is a reference of Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol which was an April Fools' joke in 1998.
* [Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol (HTCPCP/1.0): Semantics and Content (RFC 2324, section 2.3.2: 418 I'm a teapot)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2324#section-2.3.2) says:
    ```
    Any attempt to brew coffee with a teapot should result in the error code "418 I'm a teapot". The resulting entity body MAY be short and stout.
    ```
